# Employee Dashboard
This is a web app developed for Fame Technologies Internship interview.

This is a web app to track all the employee details in a company. The admin of the company adds a new employee to the database witht the time of joining.
Then the webapp creates a employee id and a unique barcode for the employee.
This database can then be used by any other application to keep track of the employees.

In order to post the blog, one needs to be the admin. Visitors can only see the blog. So here is how to  post blog:

1.  Head to "127.0.0.1:8000/admin"
2. username:  admin
   password:  djangoisawesome
3. Go to "blog post"
4. Add any blog or modify  or  delete.

To change the password  of the admin,  follow these command
  * Go to "employee" directory (which is the project directory)
  * **>>python manage.py changepassword admin**  
   This will ask for the new password. So, use a strong password.
